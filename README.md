## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/serpentspirale/Android-Game-Booster/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/serpentspirale/Android-Game-Booster/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this application, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

Development is made on Android Studio 4.1 with Gradle 6.1.1.
You can just clone the repo and get started !

**Key rules when contributing:**
-  Respect the same style as the original code (better consistency)
- It must introduce no crashes whatsoever (be error proof)
- When introducing UI changes, make sure it is ~~dumb~~ user proof. It seems simple but believe me, it isn't.
- Do **not** touch the *build.gradle* file




### Todos

 - Improve the UI smoothness by caching.
 - Improve performance with multi-threading the getGameApps and showAddPopup functions.
 - Add per-game custom resolution to override global custom resolution.
 - Add compatibility to android 4.4 ? Are modern games compatible with a 7 years old version ?
